# Sample TPCL file to set label size and feed one label
#
# Usage with IPP:
# ipptool -tv -f sample-feed-label.tpcl ipp://localhost:8000/ipp/print/TestPrinter print-job.test
#
# Label dimensions:
# - Label length: 199mm (effective print height)
# - Label width: 103mm (effective print width)
# - Gap between labels: 5mm (added to pitch)
# - Side margins: 2.5mm on each side (5mm total added to roll width)
#
# TPCL {D} command format: {Daaaa,bbbb,cccc,dddd|}
#   aaaa = Pitch length (label height + gap) in 0.1mm units
#   bbbb = Effective print width in 0.1mm units
#   cccc = Effective print height in 0.1mm units
#   dddd = Full roll width in 0.1mm units
#
# Calculations:
#   Pitch = 199mm + 5mm = 204mm = 2040 (in 0.1mm)
#   Print width = 103mm = 1030 (in 0.1mm)
#   Print height = 199mm = 1990 (in 0.1mm)
#   Roll width = 103mm + 5mm = 108mm = 1080 (in 0.1mm)

# Set label size
{D2040,1030,1990,1080|}

# Feed one label
# {T} command format: {Tabcde|}
#   a = Sensor type (2=transmissive for normal labels)
#   b = Cut (0=non-cut)
#   c = Feed mode (C=batch/tear-off)
#   d = Feed speed (3=3 inches/sec)
#   e = Ribbon (0=direct thermal, 1=thermal transfer)
